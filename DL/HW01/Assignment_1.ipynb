        "* 11 points for the report.\n",
        "* 5 points for using an **interactive** (don't reinvent the wheel with `plt.plot`) tool for viewing progress, for example TensorBoard.\n",
        "* 9 points for a network that gets $\\geq$25% accuracy on the private **test** set.\n",
        "* Up to 35 points for accuracy up to 50%, issued linearly (i.e. 0 points for 25%, 7 points for 30%, 21 points for 40%, 35 points for $\\geq$50%.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Grading Explained\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Private test set*: it's a part of the dataset like the validation set, but for which the ground truth labels are known only to us (you won't be able to evaluate your model on it). When grading, we will compute test accuracy by running your code that computes val accuracy, but having replaced the images in `'val/'` with the test set.\n",
        "* *How to submit*:\n",
        "  * **<font color=\"red\">Read this in advance, don't leave until the last minute.</font> Wrong checkpoint submission = <font color=\"red\">0 points for accuracy</font>. Be careful!**\n",
        "  * After you've trained your network, [save weights](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/saving_and_loading_a_general_checkpoint.html) to \"*checkpoint.pth*\" with `model.state_dict()` and `torch.save()`.\n",
        "  * Set `DO_TRAIN = False`, click \"Restart and Run All\" and make sure that your validation accuracy is computed correctly.\n",
        "  * Compute the MD5 checksum for \"*checkpoint.pth*\" (e.g. run `!md5sum checkpoint.pth`) and paste it into \"*solution.py*\" (`get_checkpoint_metadata()`). You'll be penalized if this checksum doesn't match your submitted file.\n",
        "  * Upload \"*checkpoint.pth*\" to Google Drive, copy the view-only link to it and paste it into \"*solution.py*\" as well.\n",
        "  * Make sure \"Restart and Run All\" also works with `DO_TRAIN = True`: trains your model and computes validation accuracy.\n",
        "  * <font color=\"red\">Important</font>: At least several hours before the deadline, **upload \"*solution.py*\" [here](http://350e-83-69-192-100.ngrok.io/) and make sure you get a \"👌\"**.\n",
        "\n",
        "* *Report*: PDF, free form; should mention:\n",
        "  * Your history of tweaks and improvements. How you started, what you searched. (*I have analyzed these and those conference papers/sources/blog posts. I tried this and that to adapt them to my problem. ...*)\n",
        "  * Which network architectures have you tried? Which of them didn't work, and can you guess why? What is the final one and why?\n",
        "  * Same for the training method (batch size, optimization algorithm, number of iterations, ...): which and why?\n",
        "  * Same for anti-overfitting (regularization) techniques. Which ones have you tried? What were their effects, and can you guess why?\n",
        "  * **Most importantly**: deep learning insights you gained. Can you give several examples of how *exactly* experience from this exercise will affect you training your future neural nets? (tricks, heuristics, conclusions, observations)\n",

        "* No pretrained networks.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Tips\n",
        "\n",
        "* **One change at a time**: don't test several new things at once (unless you are super confident that they will work). Train a model, introduce one change, train again.\n",
        "* Google a lot: try to reinvent as few wheels as possible. Harvest inspiration from PyTorch recipes, from GitHub, from blogs...\n",
        "* Use GPU.\n",
        "* Regularization is very important: L2, batch normalization, dropout, data augmentation...\n",
        "* Pay much attention to accuracy and loss graphs (e.g. in TensorBoard). Track failures early, stop bad experiments early.\n",
        "* 2-3 hours of training (in Colab) should be enough for most models, maybe 4-6 hours if you're experimenting.\n",
        "* Save checkpoints every so often in case things go wrong (optimization diverges, Colab disconnects...).\n",
        "* Don't use too large batches, they can be slow and memory-hungry. This is true for inference too.\n",
        "* Also don't forget to use `torch.no_grad()` and `.eval()` during inference."
